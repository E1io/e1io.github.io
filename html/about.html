            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I've been to three different high schools in different places, and I've learned a lot in subjects like
                computer science, engineering, digital media, and robotics. I didn't just focus on school stuff, I also
                did other activities like teaching at a BSA Scout camp and working as a handyman. I even got the top award
                from Boy Scouts, the Eagle Scout Award, and I did really well in cross-country and track & field sports.
                I like taking on leadership roles, and I've had a lot of them in scouting. Besides all this, I really enjoy
                working on robots and fixing up old cars, which shows how much I like doing hands-on and technical things.
